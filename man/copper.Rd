  Berman-Huntington points and lines data
}
\description{
  These data come from an intensive geological survey of
  a 70 x 158 km region in central Queensland, Australia.
  They consist of 67 points representing copper ore deposits,
  and 146 line segments representing geological `lineaments'.
  Lineaments are linear features, visible on a satellite image,
  that are believed to consist largely of geological faults (Berman, 1986,
  p. 55).
  It would be of great interest to predict the occurrence of copper deposits
  from the lineament pattern, since the latter can easily be observed on
  satellite images. 

  These data were introduced and analysed by Berman (1986).
  They have also been studied by Berman and Diggle (1989),
  Berman and Turner (1992),
  Baddeley and Turner (2000, 2005), Foxall and Baddeley (2002)
  and Baddeley et al (2005).
  
  Many analyses have been performed on the southern half of the data only.
  This subset is also provided.
