\details{
  Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland,
  New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania (which are states of Australia)
  and the Northern Territory (which is a `territory' of Australia)
  are represented as polygonal regions.

  Offshore territories, and smaller mainland territories, are not shown.

  The dataset \code{austates} is a tessellation object (class \code{"tess"})
  whose tiles are the states and territories.

  The coordinates are latitude and
  longitude in degrees, so the space is effectively a Mercator
  projection of the earth.
