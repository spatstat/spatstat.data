  Data and Code From JRSS Discussion Paper on Residuals
}
\description{
  This dataset contains the point patterns
  used as examples in the paper of Baddeley et al (2005).
  [Figure 2 is already available in \pkg{spatstat}
  as the \code{\link[spatstat.data]{copper}} dataset.] 

  R code is also provided to reproduce all
  the Figures displayed in Baddeley et al (2005).
  The component \code{plotfig}
  is a function, which can be called
  with a numeric or character argument specifying the Figure or Figures
  that should be plotted. See the Examples.
} 
\format{
  \code{residualspaper} is a list with the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{Fig1}{
      The locations of Japanese pine seedlings and saplings
      from Figure 1 of the paper.
      A point pattern (object of class \code{"ppp"}).
    }
    \item{Fig3}{
      The Chorley-Ribble data from Figure 3 of the paper.
      A list with three components, \code{lung}, \code{larynx}
      and \code{incin}. Each is a matrix with 2 columns
      giving the coordinates of the lung cancer cases,
      larynx cancer cases, and the incinerator, respectively.
      Coordinates are Eastings and Northings in km.
    }
    \item{Fig4a}{
      The synthetic dataset in Figure 4 (a) of the paper.
    }
    \item{Fig4b}{
      The synthetic dataset in Figure 4 (b) of the paper.
    }
    \item{Fig4c}{
      The synthetic dataset in Figure 4 (c) of the paper.
    }
    \item{Fig11}{
      The covariate displayed in Figure 11. A pixel image (object of
      class \code{"im"}) whose pixel values are distances to the
      nearest line segment in the \code{copper} data.
    }
    \item{plotfig}{A function which will compute and plot
      any of the Figures from the paper. The argument of
      \code{plotfig} is either a numeric vector or a character vector,
      specifying the Figure or Figures to be plotted. See the Examples.
