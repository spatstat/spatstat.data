\title{
  Pyramidal Neurons in Cingulate Cortex
}
\description{
  Point patterns giving the locations of pyramidal neurons in micrographs
  from area 24, layer 2 of the cingulate cortex in the human brain.
  There is one point pattern from each of 31 human subjects.
  The subjects are divided into three groups:
  controls (12 subjects), schizoaffective (9  subjects)
  and schizophrenic (10 subjects).

  Each point pattern is recorded in a unit square region; the unit of
  measurement is unknown.
  
  These data were introduced and analysed by
  Diggle, Lange and Benes (1991). 
} 
\format{
  \code{pyramidal} is a hyperframe with 31 rows, one row for each
  subject. It has a column named
  \code{Neurons} containing the point patterns of neuron locations,
  and a column named \code{group} which is a factor with levels
  \code{"control", "schizoaffective", "schizophrenic"}
  identifying the grouping of subjects.
