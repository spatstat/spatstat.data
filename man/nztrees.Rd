\title{
   New Zealand Trees Point Pattern
}
\description{
  The data give the locations of trees in a forest plot.

  They were collected by Mark and Esler (1970) and
  were extracted and analysed by Ripley (1981, pp. 169-175). 
  They represent the 
  positions of 86 trees in a forest plot approximately 140 by 85 feet.
  
  Ripley discarded from his analysis the eight trees at the right-hand edge of
  the plot (which appear to be part of a planted border)
  and trimmed the window by a 5-foot margin accordingly.
} 
\format{
  An object of class \code{"ppp"}
  representing the point pattern of tree locations.
  The Cartesian coordinates are in feet.

  See \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp.object}} for details of the format of a
  point pattern object.
