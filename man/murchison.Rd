  Murchison gold deposits
}
\description{
  Data recording the spatial locations of gold deposits and associated
  geological features in the Murchison area of Western Australia.
  Extracted from a large scale (1:500,000) study of the
  Murchison area by the Geological Survey of Western Australia
  (Watkins and Hickman, 1990). The features recorded are
  \itemize{
    \item the locations of gold deposits;
    \item the locations of geological faults;
    \item the region that contains greenstone bedrock.
  }
  The study region is contained in a \eqn{330\times 400}{330 * 400} kilometre
  rectangle. At this scale, gold deposits are points, i.e. their spatial
  extent is negligible. 
  Gold deposits in this region occur only in greenstone bedrock.
  Geological faults can be observed reliably only within the same
  region. However, some faults have been extrapolated
  (by geological ``interpretation'') outside the greenstone boundary 
  from information observed in the greenstone region.

  Deposit locations were extracted from the Minedex database
  (Geological Survey of Western Australia, n.d.) and include deposits of
  all sizes. The fault geometry and greenstone boundaries
  were mapped and collated by Watkins and Hickman (1990).

  These data were analysed by Foxall and Baddeley (2002) and Brown et al
  (2002); see also Groves et al (2000), Knox-Robinson and Groves (1997),
  Baddeley, Rubak and Turner (2015) and Baddeley (2019).
  The main aim is to predict the intensity of the
  point pattern of gold deposits from the more easily observable fault
  pattern.

\format{
  \code{murchison} is a list with the following entries:
  \describe{
    \item{gold}{a point pattern (object of class \code{"ppp"})
      representing the point pattern of gold deposits.
      See \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp.object}} for details of the format.
    }
    \item{faults}{a line segment pattern (object of class \code{"psp"})
      representing the geological faults.
      See \code{\link[spatstat]{psp.object}} for details of the format.
    }
    \item{greenstone}{the greenstone bedrock region.
      An object of class \code{"owin"}. Consists of multiple
      irregular polygons with holes.
