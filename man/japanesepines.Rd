  Japanese Pines Point Pattern
}
\description{
  The data give the locations of Japanese black pine saplings
  in a square sampling region in a natural forest.
  The observations were originally collected by Numata (1961).

  These data are used as a standard example in the textbook of 
  Diggle (2003); see pages 1, 14, 19, 22, 24, 56--57 and 61.
} 
\format{
  An object of class \code{"ppp"}
  representing the point pattern of tree locations
  in a 5.7 x 5.7 metre square, rescaled to the unit square
  and rounded to two decimal places.

  See \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp.object}} for details of the format of a
  point pattern object.
